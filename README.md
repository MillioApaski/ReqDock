# ReqDock

**A local-first API workspace for the web.** Build, send, and inspect HTTP requests in a lightweight browser client. Deploy the UI on Cloudflare Pages, with an optional locked-down Pages Functions proxy.

> Early preview (v0.1). This is not a full Postman replacement yet.

## Features

- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS requests
- Query params, custom headers, JSON/text/x-www-form-urlencoded bodies
- Bearer Token, Basic Auth, and API Key authorization
- Request collections, editable names, history (last 100), and local persistence using IndexedDB
- Environments and `{{variable}}` interpolation, plus `{{$timestamp}}` and `{{$guid}}`
- Syntax-highlighted response and JSON folding with CodeMirror; raw response and header views
- Direct browser requests and optional Cloudflare Pages Functions proxy
- cURL command import / export and ReqDock JSON backup import / export
- Dark/light theme and responsive layout

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL shown by Vite. `npm run dev` runs the UI only; the optional proxy route is not available until started with Wrangler.

```bash
npm run test
npm run build
npm run pages:dev
```

`pages:dev` serves the production build through Wrangler, including Pages Functions. For local proxy testing, add a `.dev.vars` file (never commit it):

```dotenv
REQDOCK_ALLOWED_HOSTS=api.example.com,jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
REQDOCK_PROXY_KEY=use-a-long-random-secret
```

In the UI, switch to **Proxy**, open its settings, and enter the matching key. HTTP API requests sent in **Direct** mode use browser `fetch()` and must obey the destination server's CORS policy.

## Cloudflare Pages deployment

1. In Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → Create → Pages, connect the `MillioApaski/ReqDock` GitHub repository.
2. Framework preset: **Vite** (or none). Build command: `npm run build`. Build output directory: `dist`. Project root: repository root.
3. Pages Functions are picked up automatically from the root-level `functions/` folder on Git-based deployments.
4. Optional: under Pages → Settings → Variables and Secrets, configure **both**:
   - `REQDOCK_ALLOWED_HOSTS` as a comma-separated list of **exact public DNS hostnames**, no wildcard (example: `api.example.com,jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`).
   - `REQDOCK_PROXY_KEY` as a strong **secret** value. Avoid putting it in a public environment variable prefixed with `VITE_`.
5. Redeploy after updating runtime variables. In the UI, enter the secret in Proxy settings. It is held only in memory and is not stored with requests.
6. For defense in depth, protect the Pages app **and `/api/proxy` route** using Cloudflare Access. Add WAF/rate limits if the app is exposed publicly.

The proxy refuses all requests until configured, and is restricted to exact allowlisted DNS hosts. It blocks IP-literal, localhost, special local hostnames, nonstandard ports, embedded URL credentials, and automatic redirects. Its request and response preview limits are **1 MiB** and **2 MiB**, respectively. It does not follow redirects. This is not a general-purpose public HTTP relay. DNS resolution can change after validation; use only trusted allowlist hosts.

**Important:** Free-tier capacity and restrictions may change. This is a development tool and not suitable for sensitive secrets on shared or untrusted computers. Auth values and environment variables are stored in the browser's IndexedDB, not encrypted at rest. Exported backups can contain credentials. Protect them accordingly.

## Known limitations

- Direct-mode requests can fail because of CORS, mixed-content restrictions, or browser networking rules. Cloud Proxy cannot reach `localhost`, RFC1918 addresses, or private services.
- No multipart file upload, OAuth 2.0 workflow, pre-request scripts, collection runner, WebSocket, GraphQL specialist UI, or Postman Collection import yet.
- The proxy reads a response into a capped preview buffer, rather than streaming arbitrary-sized downloads.
- cURL import supports common portable options and explicitly rejects unsupported switches.
- Workspace data is per-browser; there is no cloud sync or account system.

## Stack

React, TypeScript, Vite, CodeMirror 6, Dexie/IndexedDB, Lucide, and Cloudflare Pages Functions.

## Development

```bash
npm run test
npm run build
```

The `functions/api/proxy.js` file is a Cloudflare Pages Function and does not require a separate Node server. The static build is written to `dist/`.
